# Internode Messaging Improvements

## Learn how to upgrade an Apache CassandraÂ® cluster from 3.x to 4.x.

You will learn how to upgrade a Cassandra cluster from 3.x to 4.x. To For simplicity, you will perform a migration of a *single-node* cluster. Production Cassandra clusters always have multiple nodes. Therefore, steps have notes describing the *extra* work necessary to upgrade *multi-node* clusters.

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
* Internode messaging optimization
* Internode messaging stabilization
* Internode metrics virtual tables
